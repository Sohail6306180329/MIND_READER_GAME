# 🧠 Mind Reader (Tkinter GUI App) :-
A fun Python GUI application that pretends to read your mind by asking you to think of a number between 1 and 1000. With animated progress and messages, it creates an engaging illusion of mind-reading magic using tkinter and threading.

# 📌 Features :-
1. Clean and simple GUI made with Tkinter
2. Simulates a mind-reading experience with:
3. Progress bar animation
4. Fake brain-scanning steps
5. Final reveal of the "thought" number
6. User-friendly error handling

#  How It Works :-
1. The user is asked to think of a number between 1 and 1000 and type it in.
2. Clicking "Read My Mind" starts an animated fake scanning process.
3. After a few seconds, the app displays the exact number you were thinking of!
4. It doesn't actually read your mind 😉 — the number is taken directly from the input.

# 📂 Project Files :
 mind.py: Main script containing the full GUI logic

# 💻 Requirements :-
* Python 3.x
* No external libraries required! Everything is built using Python’s standard library.

# 🛠️ Installation & Usage:-
1. Clone the repository or download the mind_reader.py file.
2. Run the script:
    python mind.py
    Enter a number between 1 and 1000.
    Click "Read My Mind" and enjoy the experience!

# ⚠ Notes:
Make sure to enter a valid number (between 1 and 100), or the app will show an error message.
GUI will remain responsive thanks to background threading.
